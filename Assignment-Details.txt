Assignment Path:

1) Download and install python 3.*, jupyter notebook and git
2) Create a github account and specific repository for this assignment
3) Download the file
4) Make the analysis (EDA, Clustering and Anomaly)
5) Export your jupyter notebook with Name-Surname suffix. For example Clustering-Seckin-Dinc.ipynb
6) Send me your repository link

You can use my github repository (https://github.com/seckindinc/Python) as a guidance to your analysis. Try to choose max two clustering and two anomaly detection algorithms. In the end i will upload all your answers my repository to compare your codes and create a last document as a real life project.
